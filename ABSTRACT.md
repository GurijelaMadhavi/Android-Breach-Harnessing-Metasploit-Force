# Android-Breach-Harnessing-Metasploit-Force
The exploitation of Android devices presents a significant security risk, as they are prime targets for cybercriminals. This study examines the vulnerabilities in Android systems and the exploitation methods used. Using an Android emulator on Kali Linux, we leverage the Metasploit framework and MSFVenom to demonstrate the exploitation process. MSFVenom creates a customized payload targeting specific weaknesses, while Metasploit sets up a listener for remote access once a victim installs a malicious APK.Our findings reveal the technical vulnerabilities that enable these attacks and the tactics used by cybercriminals. We stress the importance of robust security measures, including user awareness and advanced defenses. This study aims to improve mobile security and provide strategies to mitigate these cybersecurityÂ threats.
